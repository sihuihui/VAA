Why heatmaps?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the columns and observation (or records) in rowa and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.</p>

<p>For this exercise, we will be using the data from <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/">World Happiness 2018 report</a>. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.</p>
<p>In the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data frame format.</p>

<p>There are many R packages and functions can be used to drawing static heatmaps, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>heatmap()of R stats package. It draws a simple heatmap.</li>
<li>heatmap.2() of gplots R package. It draws an enhanced heatmap compared to the R base function.</li>
<li>pheatmap() of pheatmap R package. pheatmap package also known as Pretty Heatmap. The package provides functions to draws pretty heatmaps and provides more control to change the appearance of heatmaps.</li>
<li>ComplexHeatmap package of R/Bioconductor package. The package draws, annotates and arranges complex heatmaps (very useful for genomic data analysis). The full reference guide of the package is available here.</li>
<li>superheat package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps. A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types. The full reference guide of the package is available here.</li>

<p>In this section, we will learn how to plot static heatmaps by using heatmap() of R Stats package.By default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap. The arguments Rowv=NA and Colv=NA are used to switch off the option of plotting the row and column dendrograms.</p>

<p>The order of both rows and columns is different compare to the native happy_matrix. This is because heatmap do a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. In addition, the corresponding dendrograms are provided beside the heatmap.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, red cells denotes small values. As the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, this makes other variables with small values all look the same.Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.</p>
